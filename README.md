# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page

## Some Notes on this Challenge

In mobile view I set a max-width of 30rem for the buttons - they seemed to be way too wide when the width got over 500px while still in mobile view.

I used a breakpoint of 900px, going all the way to 1440px seemed like too much.

I'm beginning to notice that I'm getting better at writing the HTML by looking at **_both_** the mobile and desktop specs at the beginning. This way it's easier to anticipate when wrappers will be needed for flexbox in the desktop view.
